It accepts a request for a listed symbol or a group of symbols, obtains historical price data through server-side provider adapters, derives technical and pattern observations, and returns a structured interpretation to a browser or mobile client. The important word is structured: the product is built around intermediate evidence such as indicators, detected patterns, score components, confidence limits, source metadata, and scenario diagnostics. A conclusion is therefore intended to be inspectable rather than presented as an unexplained prediction.",
            "The project is not an order-management system, a brokerage connection, a live portfolio-management service, or an investment adviser. The paper-trading features record simulated actions inside the application, while the Quant Lab simulates fixed rules against daily historical data. Neither system submits an order. That boundary is practical as well as legal: it allows research and education to move faster than a regulated execution product while still requiring the documentation to be candid about model limits.",

A reader must distinguish the current GitHub checkout from older NAS deployment records and from experimental engine work. This manual describes the checked-out source.

It initializes SQLite during the FastAPI lifespan, configures CORS and gzip, serves the browser files, attaches policy-aware API routers, and publishes health and version information. The main module also owns the distinction between a public derived-analysis site and private research routes. That decision is made at startup from environment configuration rather than from hidden client-side flags.",
            "A typical browser scan is a staged pipeline. The route validates the request, asks the market repository for a normalized history, calculates deterministic indicators, selects the configured pattern and setup logic, derives an educational plan, optionally persists noncritical history, and returns a JSON object. The public payload boundary then removes raw market-data content that should not be exposed by the public product. The browser renders this structured response; its AI explanation request is a separate step and does not replace the numerical pipeline.",

Pattern Lab can use persistent job state and a separate worker so that long-running evaluations do not occupy the web server’s request loop. Quant Lab performs a bounded synchronous research calculation in a worker thread after histories have been obtained. The two systems share a research discipline—explicit data, timing, costs, and diagnostics—but they solve different questions.",

It normalizes ticker and period inputs, reads locally cached OHLCV history, validates price and timestamp integrity, selects a configured provider when necessary, stores usable bars, and returns both the frame and provenance metadata. The metadata records source, provider, freshness, coverage, and fallback use. Quant Lab adds a fingerprint over its selected histories and configuration so a completed run can be tied to the exact material it evaluated.",
            "Cache-first behavior is a reproducibility control. A live provider can revise data, impose a rate limit, or fail in the middle of an experiment. When research uses a local cache, the user can state what data were available for the run. The cache is durable state, not disposable build output. Deployment procedures must preserve it alongside the application database, and no documentation task should copy a populated database or credential file into a public artifact.",

Polygon and Twelve Data modules keep keys in environment variables, limit calls, redact secrets in errors, and separate response normalization from higher-level analysis.

Pattern modules then evaluate candle configurations, chart structures, fair-value gaps, and structure events. The pattern analyzer coordinates broader engine generations, while the setup detector scores candidate contexts such as breakout, pullback, continuation, reversal, overextended, and no-trade states.",

The trade scorer produces an educational plan-shaped object with risk/target calculations and descriptive projections. The released product labels the public scanner model V1.0 Official Momentum; some internal functions and fallback messages retain the historical V7 name. V8 is a separate deterministic evidence-scoring candidate, VAI 1.0 is a legacy experimental logistic model, and VAI 2.2 is the newer chronological point-in-time experimental model. None of those candidate names means it has silently replaced the public scanner.",

The explanation route takes structured analysis and turns it into readable language through configured model providers or a rule-based fallback. It does not calculate RSI, decide numeric pattern confidence, or receive a free-form raw market-data feed as the primary source of truth. This is an important audit property: any language output can be compared against the structured facts it is supposed to explain.",

It supports time-series trend, cross-sectional momentum, short-horizon mean reversion, defensive low volatility, and a point-in-time corporate-quality sleeve. Each sleeve converts information available by the simulated date into target weights. Six named profiles choose transparent starting allocations: the corporate system, diversified price, balanced price, trend-first, relative-strength, and equal-weight baselines. An ensemble is therefore a named combination of documented component rules rather than a hidden optimizer.",
            "Execution timing is deliberately conservative for a daily-bar tool: a signal is formed with the session close at time t, then the target is held for the following session. Weight changes incur the user-entered base cost and, when enabled, a square-root market-impact estimate based on rolling daily dollar volume; negative weights carry the selected annual borrow cost. The controls cap individual names and gross exposure, rebalance on the requested cadence, and use trailing volatility targeting only to reduce exposure. Regime-conditioned sleeve weights can change the mixture but do not create brokerage orders.",
            "The report treats path, capacity, and data quality as first-class outputs. It includes return, volatility, drawdown, turnover, historical VaR and expected shortfall, concentration, current gross/net exposure, chronological development-versus-holdout results, walk-forward slices, regime results, factor/relative-value attribution, strategy-health decay, liquidity participation, a trailing correlation matrix, explicit correlation-convergence scenarios, a monthly net-return heatmap, equity/drawdown/rolling-volatility paths, and source coverage.

The database is deliberately treated as operational state. A code release that overwrites it can destroy user records and reproducibility, so deployment and recovery documentation must keep it outside ordinary source replacement.",

Analysis access adds an independent policy and quota layer. This allows the product to expose a limited public derived-analysis experience while preserving owner and private-research controls. It is not a substitute for a full enterprise identity, audit, or regulatory-compliance system.",

Native Swift and Xcode configuration bridge these services. A successful backend test does not validate device permissions, widget refresh, signing, or App Store behavior.",

These tools are intentionally explicit rather than magical.

Removing apparently cosmetic markup can break client initialization, so interface changes should preserve or intentionally migrate those hooks.",

Universe design materially affects reported results, so a run must identify whether it used the intended membership and should not imply survivorship-free coverage unless the data actually provides it.",

It produces labels and supporting measurements for the wider pattern report; the labels are deterministic descriptions of the implemented rules rather than guarantees about the next price movement.",

Its output feeds the pattern engine and should be compared on fixed histories after any threshold or lookback change because detection frequency can move significantly.",

The resulting zones are analytical annotations, not executable liquidity levels, and they must remain tied to the timestamp and data source that produced them.",

It is the integration point where a consumer receives coherent pattern context instead of having to combine candle, chart, structure, and gap outputs independently.",
